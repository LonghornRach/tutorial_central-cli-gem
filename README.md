# TutorialCentral

This gem scrapes data from the website 'hackr.io', which is a repository of coding tutorials. Installing this gem allows you to browse the tutorials from the command line.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tutorial_central'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tutorial_central

## Usage

The command line prompts will guide you, but you will start off by choosing to either have the most recently posted tutorials displayed or browsing all of the categories. From there you can pick a specific tutorial and the program will show you its location.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
